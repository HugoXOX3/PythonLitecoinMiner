# PythonLitecoinMiner
Here is how the provided Python script would work for solo mining Litecoin blocks:

1. It imports the necessary libraries - requests to make HTTP requests, scrypt for the hashing algorithm, socket for connecting to the mining pool, and json to encode/decode messages.

2. It sets the necessary variables - POOL_HOST, POOL_PORT to connect to the pool, the user wallet address, and the API URL to fetch the latest block details. 

3. The mine_block function fetches the latest block data from the API, increments the height to mine the next block. It then starts hashing with scrypt, incrementing the nonce each time, until it finds a hash starting with 4 leading 0s. 

4. Once a block is mined, the submit_block function connects to the pool socket, encodes the submit job message with the found block hash, sends it to the pool and prints the response.

5. The main function calls mine_block to find a block, prints the hash, and calls submit_block to submit it to the pool. 

6. It runs continuously in a loop hashing for blocks as long as the Mining flag is True.

So in summary, it solos mines Litecoin blocks by hashing incrementally with scrypt until a valid share is found, then submits it to the mining pool to validate and contribute work towards the main chain.

[Android & IOS](https://github.com/HugoXOX3/PythonLitecoinMiner#androidios)

# Build & Run For Windows  Linux  Mac

1. Change the setting 
```
POOL_HOST = "ltc.zsolo.bid"  
POOL_PORT = 4057
user = "ltc1quja3smxyr4m02f7v8tjmcwz37567k7z0rj66ac"
```

2. Install scrypt 
```
pip3 install scrypt
```

3. Run
```
python3 main.py
```

# Android&IOS

[First,Go to play store and downlaod Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)

Next,open Termux and type:

```
pkg update
pkg upgrade
pkg install python3
pkg install git
pip3 install requests colorama
git clone https://github.com/HugoXOX3/PythonLitecoinMiner.git
pip3 install scrypt
cd PythonMiner
```

Then,you need to change the wallet in this programme to yours by using nano or vim
```
POOL_HOST = "ltc.zsolo.bid"  
POOL_PORT = 4057
user = "ltc1quja3smxyr4m02f7v8tjmcwz37567k7z0rj66ac"
```


After that,You can run the programe like:
```
python3 main.py
```

Finally,Just input your Bitcoin address an enjoy mining

First,download app [ish](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/ish-shell/id1436902243) in appstore and launch it

Next,type to install stuff
```
apk add python3
apk add py3-pip
apk add git
pip3 install scrypt
git clone https://github.com/HugoXOX3/PythonLitecoinMiner.git
cd PythonMiner
```

Also you need to change the wallet in this programme to yours by using nano or vim
```
POOL_HOST = "ltc.zsolo.bid"  
POOL_PORT = 4057
user = "ltc1quja3smxyr4m02f7v8tjmcwz37567k7z0rj66ac"
```

After that type this to run miner
